<H1>About</H1>
<P>I'm a software engineer, working in Japan. My main programming language is JavaScript. I've published a number of npm modules. Sometimes I write programs in many other languages like python, ruby, groovy, java, bash etc. I also published some ruby gems, maven packages, gradle plugins.
<P>I majored Computer Science in Kyoto University and graduated in 2009 with BA degree.
<P>I often use the name `kt3k` in many places online. `kt3k` doesn't mean anything. It's just a meaningless sequence of random symbols, which I like.
<H1>Projects</H1> I'm running some personal projects. Here are some of them.
